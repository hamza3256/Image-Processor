Built an image processor in Java witht the following functionalities:

- load and display an image
- pixel value rescaling and shifting 
- perform arithmetic and Boolean operations between images 
- perform point processing and bit-plane slicing 
- perform a convolution on the image for
  - smoothing the image
  - edge detection in the image 
- perform order statistic filtering

Image processing algorithms to improve/alter the image contrast using:

- histogram equalisation 
- thresholding 

Incremental improvements were also made to the program such as being able to select a Region of Interest (ROI) to perform image
processing functions on that ROI. 

Made the program user friendly by implementing a menu system. The menu system allows user to perform multiple image processing functions to one or multiple images, and/or ROI of a given image. 

I have also included an "undo" function to undo image additions or function processes on any given image.
