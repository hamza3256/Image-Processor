Built an image processor in Java that:

- loads and displays an image
- pixel value rescaling and shifting 
- performs arithmetic and Boolean operations between images 
- performs point processing and bit-plane slicing 
- performs a convolution on the image for
  - smoothing the image
  - edge detection in the image 
- performs order statistic filtering

Furthermore, to enhance the program with a number of image processing algorithms to improve/alter the
image contrast:

- histogram equalisation 
- thresholding 

Also, able to enhance the program to be able to select a Region of Interest (ROI), enable to perform the image
processing functions on the ROI. 

Able to enhance the program with a menu system. Allow to perform a combination of image
processing functions on the ROI. Includes an "undo" function.
