Built an image processor in Java that:

 loads and displays an image
 pixel value rescaling and shifting 
 performs arithmetic and Boolean operations between images 
 performs point processing and bit-plane slicing 
 performs a convolution on the image for
o smoothing the image
o edge detection in the image 
 performs order statistic filtering

Furthermore, to enhance the program with a number of image processing algorithms to improve/alter the
image contrast:

 histogram equalisation 
 thresholding 
3. Enhance the program to be able to select a Region of Interest (ROI). Perform the image
processing function on the ROI. 
4. Enhance the program with a menu system. Be able to perform a combination of image
processing functions on the ROI. Include an "undo" function.
