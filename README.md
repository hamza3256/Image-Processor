Built an image processor in Java witht the following functionalities:

- load and display an image
- pixel value rescaling and shifting 
- perform arithmetic and Boolean operations between images 
- perform point processing and bit-plane slicing 
- perform a convolution on the image for
  - smoothing the image
  - edge detection in the image 
- performs order statistic filtering

Image processing algorithms to improve/alter the image contrast:

- histogram equalisation 
- thresholding 

Incremental improvements were also made to the program such as able to select a Region of Interest (ROI) to perform image
processing functions on the ROI. 

Also improved the program with a menu system. Allowing the user to perform multiple image
processing functions on the ROI. I also included an "undo" function to undo an image addition or function processes on any given image.
